Ways to achieve this can include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect-oriented programming (AOP)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">Monkey-Patching</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> techniques.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="sect4">\n<h5 id="_intent_10">Intent</h5>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Find out how the system is really used and what the runtime relationships are,\nas well as other facts that can not be easily determined by\n<a href="#Static-Code-Analysis">Section 2.3.25, &#8220;<span class="pattern">Static Code Analysis</span>&#8221;</a> even in situation where the system under design is\nlargely undocumented and the architecture work thus mostly relies on\nassumptions, interviews and lore.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="sect4">\n<h5 id="_description_10">Description</h5>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In many languages today it is possible to define operation that alter the\nbehavior of certain structures in the system without modifying the original\nsource code. In Java this is often done by byte code instrumentation, in Ruby,\nPHP and some other languages there are built in mechanisms to (re-) define the\nbehavior of system classes or libraries.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In theory instrumenting the system therefore is a straightforward process:</p>\n</div>\n<div class="ulist">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Identify and describe the concern that shall be explored (e.g.\nobject creation, function entries and exits, code execution or something\nelse that can be described in the terms of the mechanism used).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write the code that collects the data about the system behavior (e.g. sends it\nto a syslog, writes it to a file, sends it to a dedicated server, creates an\nSNMP Trap etc.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use the (language specific) mechanism to create the instrumented version of\nthe system</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replace (part of) the currently operational system with the instrumented version</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collect the data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Replace the instrumented version with the previously operational version</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In real life, since the mechanisms of instrumentation varies widely, specific ways\nmust be found for each scenario.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>While tools like AspectJ provide easy ways to instrument Java code and Rubyâ€™s\nmetaprogramming model allows for easy introduction of cross-cutting functionality\nthe same gets harder to do with other languages. In some languages it may be\nnecessary to modify a dynamically linked library with central operations to\nintroduce instrumentation without modifying the original system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="admonitionblock tip">\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td class="icon">\n<div class="title">Tip</div>\n</td>\n<td class="content">\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>A special form of this pattern, especially useful for interpreted languages, is\n<em>instrumenting the source code manually</em>. Basically all you do here is manually type in\nthe code to collect the information you&#8217;re interested in.
