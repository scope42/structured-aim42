Through well-thought protocols and cooperation guidelines, software architects, developers as much as entire organizations try to orchestrate proper coordination and cooperation but many times such attempts are burdened by sub-optimal organisational decisions, e.g., the adoption of a process model that is not compatible with developers and operatorsâ€™ background and mindset or even collaborating with an organization that does not and cannot share the same values of the organization in question. These circumstances often result in additional project cost in the form of recurrent delays, condescending behaviour or worse.</p>\n</div>'
