The observation being that, the\npeople had (1) a clear mission; (2) manpower; (3) (raw) materials; (4) time and (5) technology. The project failed because\nof communication, and its consequent organization. Brooks further states that in software systems schedule\ndisasters, functional misfits and system bugs arise from a lack of communication between different teams. Quoting Brooks <strong>“The\npurpose of organization is to reduce the amount of communication and coordination necessary;</strong> hence organization is a radical\nattack on the communication problems…”.</em> What many organization like Amazon, SoundCloud, Otto or Google do these days is to\ncreate self-contained, cross-functional teams with a high cohesion inside the team and loose coupling between the teams.</p>\n</div>'

Preferably, components\nshould be independent from each other as much as possible. For teams the same should be true, different teams should communicate\nas little as possible. Adrian Cockcroft said regarding the independence between service teams that "<em>You don’t go and\nhave a deep discussion with the Google Maps team just to use their Maps API: it&#8217;s a reasonably stable\nAPI, you are isolated, it&#8217;s sort of versioned, occasionally it changes and you may want to do things. So basically you\nbuild your own service, you build a bounded context around the thing that your team, your 2 or 3 engineers, are building\nand you build a service or a group of services that interface with all the other things that your company is doing, as\nif they were separate companies. It’s a different bounded context. <strong>So you talk to them but you are not tightly coupled</em></strong>".</p>\n</div>'
