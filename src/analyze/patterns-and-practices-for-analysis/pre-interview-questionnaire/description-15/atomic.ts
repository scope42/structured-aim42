    '<div class="paragraph">\n<p>A specialisation of <a href="#Questionnaire">questionnaire</a> - targeted to be used by stakeholders (aka your interview partners). As with the more general <a href="#Questionnaire">questionnaire</a> you need to collect appropriate topics, questions and suggestions. Remember to apply <a href="#Stakeholder-Specific-Communication">stakeholder-specific communication</a>: It might be useful to create different questionnaires per stakeholder or a group of stakeholders. This can lead to more work for you as interviewer, but will also lead to better interview results.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Mix open and closed questions:</p>\n</div>\n<div class="ulist">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>open questions require stakeholders to formulate answers on their own. For example "How did you&#8230;&#8203;?" or "Please explain&#8230;&#8203;?"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>closed questions ask stakeholders to select from several predefined choices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Include a "Comments/Remarks" section at the end of the questionnaire, so stakeholders can comment on topics you did not consider in advance. The <a href="#Pre-Interview-Questionnaire">Section 2.3.16, &#8220;<span class="pattern">Pre Interview Questionnaire</span>&#8221;</a> shall be handed over to the appropriate stakeholders in advance, a few days before the interview. As these documents will be read and processed by external and potentially critical stakeholders, you need to care for several details:</p>\n</div>\n<div class="ulist">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Stakeholder specific terminology: Ensure your questions will be understandable by the target audience. See <a href="#Stakeholder-Specific-Communication">[Stakeholder-Specific-Communication]</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure nice layout and (visual) readability. Your questionnaire shall be fun to work with.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure timely delivery to your stakeholders, so they have enough time to think about their answers. Do never force your stakeholders to answer questions under time pressure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>'
