    '<div class="ulist">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Needs moderation</strong>: Brainstorming quality requirements usually works well in moderated workshops. If given (even trivial) examples, every stakeholder will most likely write down several scenarios. We often received 80-120 different scenarios in one-day workshops.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uncovers problems and risks</strong>: Scenarios collected within brainstorming sessions often contain <em>hidden</em> problem descriptions, risks or problems with the current systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Covers organization and process</strong>: Scenarios sometimes cover process or organizational aspects (like release cycles should be faster than they are now). Move those to your <a href="#Improvement-Backlog">Section 5.14, &#8220;<span class="pattern">Improvement Backlog</span>&#8221;</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improves human communication</strong>: Different stakeholders often start communicating about the system or their requirements during such workshops.
