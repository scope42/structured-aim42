For instance, if our application regularly crashes with Out-Of-Memory-Errors it might be a reflex to increase the memory settings. Instead we should ask if this is really the problem or only a symptom of the real problem, e.g. a programming failure in memory releasing. With an iterative process of asking "Why?" the causal chain must be traced down to the root cause.</p>\n</div>'
