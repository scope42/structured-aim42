Levels of Reaction when presented with problems</div>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>From enthusiasm to neutrality things will be easy, but from here on it gets interesting or difficult, however you might call it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="olist arabic">\n<ol class="arabic">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enthusiasm</strong>:\nSome people will embrace your findings - like "that&#8217;s what we always said&#8230;&#8203;". Enthusiasts sometimes expect that findings or the appropriate\nimprovement approaches directly improve their own situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agreement</strong>:\nOthers will agree, without further ado.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Neutrality</strong>:\nSome stakeholders won&#8217;t care. These are probably unconcerned by\nany finding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Amazement</strong>:\nYour results will amaze or astonish some people. Although they would never have expected your findings, amazed stakeholders might be convinced to agreement or neutrality by using explanation and proofs in stakeholder-specific language or communication. On the other hand, amazed stakeholders pose the serious risk of becoming more negative (doubtful or resisting) if you fail to convince them - or if other people (your opponents, for example) manage to bring them over to the <em>dark side</em>&#8230;&#8203;</p>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Always ask amazed stakeholders <em>why</em> for the reasons of their amazement - that can help you in your argumentation.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Doubt</strong>:\nYou will hear or read "Can&#8217;t be, impossible!" or similar expressions\nfrom some people. If these stakeholders can explain the reasons for their doubts, you might find ways to improve your explanation (maybe your issues were simply ill-formulated) or you have to look for additional and better ways to explain. Doubt can lead you to errors or ommissions in your own argumentation or conclusions.</p>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Some doubtful stakeholders will be emotional - and therefore not open for rational or objective arguments. That&#8217;s a serious and difficult communication problem - beyond the scope of this document.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Minimization</strong>, sometimes disavowal:\nThis is the first level of denial. The fact itself is accepted, but its consequences, evaluations or seriousness are denied. In practice we encountered this phenomenon quite often: Affected stakeholders repeat their assessment "problem acknowledged, but the consequences are only minimal" like a mantra. Other stakeholders, especially doubtful or amazed ones, might start to believe in this minimization tactic - especially if the truth implies inconvenient or uncomfortable changes in their own working environment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Resistance</strong>:\nFindings are opposed, either actively or passively.</p>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In case you encounter minimization or resistance, get support from the highest management level you can access: As a consequence some, if not many, minimizing or resisting stakeholders will turn to your side.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Hostility</strong>, or "<em>Shoot the messenger</em>". Always remain calm and polite - but hard in your argumentation and facts. Hostile stakeholders can rarely be convinced of something, but need to be handled with diplomacy, politics and organizational skills (none of which we can cover here).</p>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Be prepared for <em>hostile actions</em>, though: In case of critical issues, always keep details documentation of their origin. Be prepared to <em>proof</em> those issues, remove even minor omissions or formal weaknesses in your argumentation. Your issues and <a href="#Root-Cause-Analysis">Section 2.3.20, &#8220;<span class="pattern">Root Cause Analysis</span>&#8221;</a> has to be flawless and backed by meticulous research and management support. Ensure <a href="#Traceability">Section 5.20, &#8220;<span class="pattern">Traceability</span>&#8221;</a> of your chain of reasoning! Keep written records of <a href="#Stakeholder-Interview">Section 2.3.24, &#8220;<span class="pattern">Stakeholder Interview</span>&#8221;</a> and of suspicious pieces of source code or documentation.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Let others review your findings before publication.</p>\n</div>'
