    '<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In one audit of a European Logistic Company (&gt; 40.000 employees) we found serious issues within their development processes, in addition to some issues in their source code. The process problems caused massive (&gt; 3 months) delays in delivery of working software to production, whereas the pure software bugs were relatively minor in their consequences. When we presented these issues, all process-related issues were minimized or doubted by senior management of the IT department.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>With the help of the CIO, we identified those minimizers to be the root cause of most process issues, as they had themselves introduced inefficient, formal and bloated processes.</p>\n</div>'
