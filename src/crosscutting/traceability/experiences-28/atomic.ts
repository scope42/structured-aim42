These stakeholders immediately suspected <em>all</em> our findings, not only the one or two in question.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>Please keep in mind that a lack of traceability, especially for disputed findings or problems,\nmight lead to serious loss of credibility.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>On the other hand, maintaining detailed references is a time-consuming task.
