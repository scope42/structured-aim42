    '<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In a review for a financial broker we agreed initially to deliver a detailed document with the results. When we were later asked to present the outcomes to two different audiences (engineers and management) it was quite easy to create specific slides for both of them from the ~ 40 pages of documentation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="paragraph">\n<p>In another case we planned to present out review finding in one big meeting and so we wrapped all findings into briefly and concise slides. Later some executives who missed the meeting complained that they needed some spoken explanations to understand the presentation document. We spent much more time in subsequently writing out the background information as if we had worked on a result document from beginning on.</p>\n</div>'
