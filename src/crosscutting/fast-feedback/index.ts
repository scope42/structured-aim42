Usually it&#8217;s about "frequent, accurate, specific and timely, and FAST feedback" in evaluation of different topics e.g. performance evaluation. Fast Feedback means that we don&#8217;t want to wait for six to twelve months until we get results or answers on a specific question. Instead we keep participants in a constant feedback loop so they immediately exchange information once they receive it.</p>\n</div>'
